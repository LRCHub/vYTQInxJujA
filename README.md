# Akeboshi – Wind

```
Cultivate your hunger
before you idealize
Motivate your anger
to make them realize
Climbing the mountain.
Never coming down?
Break in to the contents.
Never falling down
<♪>
My knee is still shaking
like I was twelve
Sneaking out the class room
by the back door
A man railed at me twice
but I didn't care
Waiting is wasting
for people like me
Don't try to live so wise.
Don't cry coz you're so right.
Don't dry with fakes or fears.
Coz you will hate yourself
in the end.
Don't try to live so wise.
Don't cry coz you're so right.
Don't dry with fakes or fears.
Coz you will hate yourself
in the end.
You say“dreams are dreams.
I ain't gonna
play the fool anymore.
You say
“coz I still got my soul.”
Take your time baby
your blood needs to slow down.
“Breach your soul.”
“Reach yourself
before you gloom.”
Reflection of fear makes
shadows of nothing.
shadows of nothing.
<♪>
You still are blind
if you see the winding road.
Coz there is always
a straight way
to the point you see
Don't try to live so wise.
Don't cry coz you're so right.
Don't dry with fakes or fears.
Coz you will hate yourself
in the end.
<♪>
Don't try to live so wise.
Don't cry coz you're so right.
Don't dry with fakes or fears.
Coz you will hate yourself
in the end.
Don't try to live so wise.
Don't cry coz you're so right.
Don't dry with fakes or fears.
Coz you will hate yourself
in the end.
Coz you will hate yourself
in the end.
Coz you will hate yourself
in the end.
Coz you will hate yourself
in the end.
Coz you will hate yourself
in the end.
