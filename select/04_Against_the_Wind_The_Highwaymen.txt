It seems like yesterday
But it was long ago
She was lovely, she was the queen of our nights
There in the darkness, with the radio playing low

The secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
There was nothin' left to burn and nothin' left to prove

And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it would never end
I remember how she held me oh-so-tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were runnin' against the wind
We were young and strong
But just runnin' against the wind

The years rolled slowly past
I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home

I guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was livin' to run and runnin' to live
Never worryin' about payin' or how much I owed

Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all the rules I could bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

Against the wind
We were runnin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind

All those drifter's days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
We were runnin' against the wind
We found ourselves seekin' shelter against the wind

Against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
