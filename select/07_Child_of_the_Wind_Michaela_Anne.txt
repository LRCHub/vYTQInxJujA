I could say "See you later"
But I'll just go with "Goodbye"
Sure has been a nice night
But it's time for me to drive
Before I go I'll tell you
Something 'bout this heart of mine
My hometown was a back seat
Looking out at highway signs

I'm a child of the wind
Always coming through and taking off again
Everybody's temporary friend
I'm a child of the wind

On the road in California
With the windows all rolled down
I'm driving by myself
But I've got a friend in every town
Sure, I might get lonesome
When the desert turns to night
But just like every new kid knows
Looking out at highway signs

I'm a child of the wind
Always coming through and taking off again
Everybody's temporary friend
I'm a child of the wind

Don't need time to heal a broken heart
When most things end before they even start

Everybody's temporary friend
I'm a child of the wind
I'm a child of the wind
I'm a child of the wind
