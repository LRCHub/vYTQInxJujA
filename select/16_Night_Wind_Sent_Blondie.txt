Your music by the night wind sent
Awakes my quiet instrument
In the silence of your steps
I can see into the depths
Messenger of sympathies
My heart beats loud in ecstasy
When your shadow falls on me
A silhouette reality
And I chase every night after you
And I chase after you
Of all your loaded mysteries
The color of your sympathies
My words cannot express your awful loveliness
So come with me through smoke and mirrors
We'll bring our differences nearer
We'll float upon an inland sea
Embody visions of a dream
And I chase every night after you
I got a chill and the night wind sent
Me a chill
And the night wind sent
Me a chill
You wander through my sleeping mind
Reading thoughts I've left behind
I always know when you've been there
Tangles of perfume fill my hair
Your music by the night wind sent
Awakes my quiet instrument
In the silence of your steps
I can see into the depths
